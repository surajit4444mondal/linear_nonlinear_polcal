I, with the help of Devojyoti, wrote these codes to investigate the effect of linear and non-linear polarisation calibration schemes, under various conditions. In particular, I have tested the cases, where the instrumental leakage is low and high. Under each possibility, I have also investigated the effect when the source has high and low polarisation fractions. For the linear calibration scheme, I have used CASA. For the non-linear calibration scheme, I have used quartical as well as a code I wrote. While the codes were developed by me, I have discussed the details of the procedure with Devojyoti and we are in complete agreement about the results and the methodology. So, this is really a joint effort and should be treated as such. In the spirit of reproducibility, we thought that it is better to upload all codes used in this work on Github, along with a detailed description of the steps which is needed to run this code as well as the understanding we get from it.
